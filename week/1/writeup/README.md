## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the ELMS assignment.

### Part 2 (75 pts)

Since the job is to audit the software for vulnerabilities, the job already likely has in place procedures of how the vulnerabilities are disclosed to the company. Thus first I would start by following any written procedures for the job. Moving on, my supervisor would be a good contact to escalate the problem. If for whatever reason that was not an option, writing up details on the vulnerability to pass onto the main developer team responsible for the vulnerable software would be the next course of action. So far, everything about the vulnerability has been kept internal within the company, and given or disclosed to the people with the power to fix the vulnerability. Disclosing this information to the outside public before the company has a chance to respond to the vulnerability does nothing except harm/embarrass the company, as they should be given a reasonable amount of time to correct the software. However, if the company actively decides to release the vulnerable and dangerous software and ignore the warnings, then it becomes ethical to release some limited information about the vulnerability to the public. If the company is not listening to warnings about the software, then disclosing some information to public forums/contacting organizations that specialize in cybersecurity news informing them about what the vulnerability can do, and perhaps a proof of concept without a full release of how the vulnerability can be fully executed would be the next form of action. This is a greatly debated step in responsible disclosure in cybersecurity, since releasing proof of concept attacks can still help malicious actors execute the vulnerability in certain cases. If you disclose that organization A has a SQL vulnerability that allows for user records to be accessed, and do not disclose where the SQL injection is, attackers can still scan the site looking since they know the vulnerability exists. However, whether you disclose to the public or not, the vulnerability still exists. Hackers may already have access to the vulnerability and may be utilizing it for malicious gains without the public's knowledge. The public should be engaged and aware of potential threats to the security of the programs and organizations that they use. Additionally, releasing limited information into the open allows the public to pressure the organization to fix and ensure the product is safe. If you have the knowledge that something that is dangerous that other people consider safe, then you have a moral obligation to put in effort or action to making the situation safer. Several NASA engineers raised concerns about O-Rings operating under colder than normal temperatures that were in use for the upcoming launch of the Challenger Space Shuttle. After the explosion, many of the engineers that knew of the problem blame themselves for not doing more to prevent the disaster. If I knew the security vulnerability was present and dangerous in the ECU, which then caused a death, it would be very difficult to tell that family that I knew of the vulnerability and the dangers it presented, but then decided to do nothing about it.
